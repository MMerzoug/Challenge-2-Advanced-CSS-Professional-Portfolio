                        This project involves optimizing a marketing agency's website to comply with
                        accessibility standards, enhancing its search engine optimization (SEO). By leveraging semantic
                        HTML elements, logical structure, accessible alt attributes, proper heading hierarchy, and
                        descriptive titles, the website became more user-friendly and inclusive. The process underscored
                        the interplay between accessibility, user experience, and SEO, highlighting the importance of
                        these elements in creating an effective web presence.
